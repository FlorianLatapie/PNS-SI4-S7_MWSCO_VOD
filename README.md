## How to run 
Using Java JDK 17.0

Use the two folders (Server_VOD & Client_VOD) as separate projects in your IDE. 
1. run `main.Main.main(String[] args);` from Server_VOD
2. run `main.Main.main(String[] args);` from Client_VOD

## Implemented bonus tasks
- [x] save credentials in a file (server-side) and read that file whenever the server is launched, so you could stop and restart your server without losing data.
