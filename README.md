# PNS-SI4-S7_MWSCO_VOD

## Students
- Ludovic BAILET
- Florian LATAPIE

## How to run 
Use the two folders (Server_VOD & Client_VOD) as separate projects in your IDE. 
1. run main.Main.main(String[] args); from Server_VOD
2. run main.Main.main(String[] args); from Client_VOD

## Implemented bonus tasks
- [x] save credentials in a file (server-side) and read that file whenever the server is launched, so you could stop and restart your server without losing data.
